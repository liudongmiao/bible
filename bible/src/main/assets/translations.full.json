In 1870, an invitation was extended to American religious leaders for scholars to work on the RV project. A year later, Protestant theologian Philip Schaff chose 30 scholars representing the denominations of Baptist, Congregationalist, Dutch Reformed, Friends, Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Protestant Episcopal, and Unitarian. These scholars began work in 1872.</p><p>The RV New Testament was released In 1881; the Old Testament was published in 1885. The ASV was published in 1901 by Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons. In 1928, the International Council of Religious Education (the body that later merged with the Federal Council of Churches to form the National Council of Churches) acquired the copyright from Nelson and renewed it the following year.</p><p>The divine name of the Almighty (the Tetragrammaton) is consistently rendered Jehovah in the ASV Old Testament, rather than LORD as it appears in the King James Bible.</p><p>The ASV was the basis of four revisions. They were the Revised Standard Version, 1971, the Amplified Bible, 1965, the New American Standard Bible, 1995, and the Recovery Version, 1999. A fifth revision, known as the World English Bible, was published in 2000 and was placed in the public domain. The ASV was also the basis for Kenneth N. Taylor's Bible paraphrase, The Living Bible, 1971.</p><p>This Bible is in the public domain in the United States. We are making it available in the same format in which we acquired it as a public service.</p>🔗<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/versions/American-Standard-Version-ASV-Bible/\">Bible Gateway</a>",

The New Testament influenced the Authorized Version.</p><p>Between 1749 and 1752, English bishop Richard Challoner substantially revised the translation with an aim to improve readability and comprehensibility.

Not long after, the whole Bible was printed in 1905. The translation was called the <em>Ang Biblia</em>. This version was patronized by users of the <em>Tagalog</em> language for a long time.</p><p>Like the first <em>Ang Biblia</em>, this revision is a formal translation. This means that the translators strived to faithfully reflect the form of the original biblical languages into <em>Tagalog</em>, insofar as its grammar and syntax allow. The Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia was used as basis for the translation of the Old Testament for this revision. Although the Greek text of Westcott-Hort of 1881 was used for the New Testament of the first <em>Ang Biblia</em>, the translators of this revision used the 4th edition of the United Bible Societies's Greek New Testament.</p><h5>Quotation Rights</h5><p>The <em>AB </em>text may be quoted (in written, visual, or electronic form) without requesting permission from the Philippine Bible Society provided that the number of verses does not exceed five hundred (500) and that the verses quoted represent less than half a complete book of the Bible. In all other cases, the user must first get permission from the Philippine Bible Society.

The result is a version that is easy to read and understand, but faithful to the meaning of the original biblical texts. The MBB is translated from the Hebrew and Greek textual bases which are recognized by many scholars worldwide as the best and most-trusted bases for translation. In this light, readers are assured that the <em>Magandang Balita Biblia</em> version of the Holy Bible is a faithful, understandable, and contextually appropriate translation.</p><h5>Quotation Rights</h5><p>The <em>MBB</em> text may be quoted (in written, visual, or electronic form) without requesting permission from the Philippine Bible Society provided that the number of verses does not exceed five hundred (500) and that the verses quoted represent less than half a complete book of the Bible.
